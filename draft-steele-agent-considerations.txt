2.  Conventions and Definitions

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in
   BCP 14 [RFC2119] [RFC8174] when, and only when, they appear in all
   capitals, as shown here.

3.  Considerations Sections

   IETF documents commonly include dedicated sections addressing
   security, privacy, and operational aspects of protocols and
   technologies.  These consideration sections serve multiple critical
   purposes: they guide document authors in performing due diligence
   during protocol design, inform implementers and deployers about
   potential risks and design trade-offs, and provide structured
   guidance for agents assisting developers in producing software
   implementations.

3.1.  Value to Authors and Implementers

   When developing specifications that involve agents—whether autonomous
   systems, software agents, or AI-driven components—authors should
   carefully evaluate the applicability of established consideration
   frameworks.  These frameworks provide systematic approaches to
   identifying and documenting design choices that affect security,
   privacy, and operations.

   *Security Considerations*: All IETF documents must include security
   analysis per [RFC3552].  This BCP defines the Internet threat model
   (passive and active attacks, eavesdropping, replay, man-in-the-
   middle, denial of service) and security goals (confidentiality,
   integrity, authentication).  For agent-based systems, authors must
   document:

   *  Threat modeling for autonomous decision-making and agent authority

   *  Authentication and authorization mechanisms for agent actions

   *  Protection against malicious agents or compromised agent behavior

   *  Which attacks are in-scope versus out-of-scope and why

   *  Cryptographic protections and their limitations

   The structured threat analysis helps agents reading specifications
   identify security-critical code paths, understand attack surfaces,
   and generate appropriate security controls during implementation.

   *Privacy Considerations*: Agent systems often collect, process, or
   transmit data about individuals through automated mechanisms.
   [RFC6973] provides a questionnaire-based framework for analyzing
   privacy implications across three mitigation areas:

   *  Data minimization: identifiers, fingerprinting, correlation, and
      retention

   *  User participation: control, consent, and transparency mechanisms

   *  Security: protection of personal data and privacy-relevant
      information

   Authors should evaluate whether agents create new privacy threats
   through automated data collection, behavioral profiling, cross-
   context correlation, or persistent tracking.  For agents implementing
   protocols, these sections provide concrete guidance on:

   *  Which data elements contain personal information

   *  What identifiers can be correlated across protocol interactions

   *  Required user consent mechanisms before data sharing

   *  Data retention requirements and deletion policies

   This structured privacy analysis enables implementing agents to
   correctly handle sensitive data, implement required consent flows,
   and avoid privacy-violating patterns.

   *Operational Considerations*: Deploying and managing agent systems
   presents unique operational challenges.  [RFC5706] guides authors to
   address deployment aspects at the design phase rather than
   retrofitting later:

   *  Installation and initial setup procedures

   *  Migration paths from existing systems

   *  Fault detection, isolation, and root cause analysis

   *  Configuration management and verification

   *  Performance monitoring at protocol, device, network, and service
      levels

   *  Impact on network operations

   For agents, additional considerations include agent lifecycle
   management, coordination between multiple agents, and mechanisms for
   human oversight or intervention.  When agents assist in
   implementation, operational considerations sections provide:

   *  Deployment prerequisites and dependencies

   *  Configuration parameters and valid ranges

   *  Monitoring and telemetry requirements

   *  Error conditions and recovery procedures

   *  Interoperability requirements with existing systems

3.2.  Value to Agents Assisting Implementation

   Agents reading internet drafts to assist developers benefit
   significantly from well-structured consideration sections.  These
   sections provide machine-parseable patterns for:

   1.  *Security Requirements Translation*: Agents can extract threat
       models and map them to specific code requirements (input
       validation, authentication checks, cryptographic operations, rate
       limiting).

   2.  *Privacy-by-Design Implementation*: Privacy considerations
       specify what data minimization techniques to apply, which
       identifiers should be ephemeral, and what consent mechanisms to
       implement before data collection.

   3.  *Operational Instrumentation*: Operational considerations inform
       agents which metrics to expose, what configuration options to
       support, how to implement health checks, and what management
       interfaces to provide.

   4.  *Testing and Validation*: Consideration sections identify attack
       scenarios to test against, privacy properties to verify, and
       operational failure modes to handle.

   5.  *Documentation Generation*: Agents can extract deployment
       requirements, configuration guidance, and operational procedures
       from consideration sections to generate implementation
       documentation.

3.3.  Guidance for Authors

   Authors should assess which consideration sections are relevant to
   their specification and provide substantive, specific analysis rather
   than placeholder text.  When a consideration area is not applicable,
   a brief explanation of why should be provided.  For specifications
   involving agents or autonomous systems, authors should explicitly
   address:

   *  How agent autonomy affects traditional security models

   *  What privacy implications arise from automated data processing

   *  How agent behavior can be monitored, configured, and controlled
      operationally

   The goal is to ensure that both human implementers and agents
   assisting with implementation have sufficient information to build
   secure, privacy-respecting, and operationally manageable systems.
